# Btls: The Transport Layer Security Protocol

[![build](https://github.com/bcrypto/btls/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bcrypto/btls/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

## What is Btls?

Btls is the informal name of STB 34.101.65, the official standard of Belarus.
Btls compiles several RFC that defines the 
[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) 
protocol and its extensions legalizing 
[TLS 1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246.txt) in Belarus.

Btls also defines 8 ciphersuites based on algorithms of 
[STB 34.101.31](https://github.com/bcrypto/belt) 
and [STB 34.101.45](https://github.com/bcrypto/bign).

## Reference implementation

Ciphersuites of Btls are implemented [here](https://github.com/bcrypto/bee2evp) 
via a patch for [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl). 

## What is this repo?

In this repo, we process comments on the current version of Btls,
discuss future versions, provide additional supporting material.

The latest releases of Btls can be found at 
[Releases](https://github.com/bcrypto/btls/releases).

Comments and proposals are processed at 
[Issues](https://github.com/bcrypto/btls/issues).
